<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am Ashish Kumar, a 24-year-old electrical engineer working at NTPC as a power engineer. My role involves ensuring the efficient operation and management of energy resources, and I take pride in contributing to such a crucial sector. Over the years, I've developed a strong foundation in electrical engineering, which has allowed me to excel in my career and grow as a professional.</p>

<p>I’m based in Greater Noida, India, and while I have achieved a great deal in the field of engineering, I’ve recently felt a strong pull towards expanding my skill set. This led me to start learning web development, a field that has always intrigued me. I believe that diversifying my knowledge in technology will not only enhance my career but also allow me to explore new and exciting opportunities.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working hard to master the skills required to become a web developer. This journey is both challenging and rewarding, and I am fully committed to seeing it through. My goal is to bring the same level of dedication and expertise to web development as I have in my engineering career, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
